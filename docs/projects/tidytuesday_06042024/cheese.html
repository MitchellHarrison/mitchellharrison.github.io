<p>Welcome to TidyTuesday! This is a quick demonstration of the new Quarto dashboard functionality, which allows for quick-and-easy construction of data visualization dashboards with a markdown-like syntax. If you want the full source code for this dashboard (only about 200 lines!!), click <a href="https://github.com/MitchellHarrison/mitchellharrison.github.io/blob/main/projects/tidytuesday_06042024/cheese.qmd">here</a>.</p>
<p>Of course, if you want to discuss the project, reach out on <a href="https://discord.gg/vF6W2bdKFH">Discord</a> or say thanks by <a href="https://buymeacoffee.com/mitchellharrison">buying me a coffee</a>. Enjoy!</p>
