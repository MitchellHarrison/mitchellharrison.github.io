After leaving the Navy in 2022, I moved to North Carolina to study data science 
and political science at Duke University. Finishing my degree cost the military 
about $60,000 in aid and depleted my savings. Even my parents, who probably 
thought they could start spending their "put their kid through college" fund on 
fun things, had to chip in to help. My education was world-class but utterly 
unattainable for the majority of us. This website is my attempt to turn my 
course notes, homework, and projects into comprehensible articles for free. If 
nothing else, future Duke students struggling through their data science degree 
can look here for a different perspective.

If you want to see some of my analysis work, head to the 
[Projects tab](projects.qmd)! If you are here to learn, the 
[Tutorials tab](tutorials.qmd) is for you. Of course, if you are curious about 
the website's structure, it is built with R and Quarto, and the code is 
available by clicking on the GitHub icon at the bottom-left of every page 
(or click 
[here](https://github.com/MitchellHarrison/mitchellharrison.github.io)).

Access to information should always be free, so every article here is, and 
always will be, at no cost. If you want to show financial support, you can 
[buy me a coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/mitchellharrison)! But I won't ever 
make donor-exclusive educational content, so don't feel like you're missing out 
by not donating. It's just one way to show thanks. 

I hope you enjoy the site, and feel free to reach out via GitHub issues to make 
suggestions for articles. Thanks for reading!
