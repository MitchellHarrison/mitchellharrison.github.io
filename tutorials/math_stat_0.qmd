# Background
I recently finished 
[STA 432](https://stat.duke.edu/courses/theory-and-methods-statistical-learning-and-inference-0) 
at Duke. For my fellow Duke students looking to take it: yes, it was that hard. 
But you're smarter than me, so you will be fine! For the mathematically curious, 
the course is (somewhat longwindedly) called "Theory and Methods of Statistical 
Learning and Inference." If, like me, you prefer helpful course names, call it 
"Mathematical Statistics." 

While in STA 432, I kept finding myself in mathematics far beyond the "Google 
the topic and find it on 100 websites" stage. In fact, the topics covered in the 
course were typically covered by sources that assumed a level of mathematical 
maturity that I did not possess. I kept thinking that I needed to pre-understand 
the material to understand the explanation of that same material. I longed for a 
plain-language introduction to mathematically rigorous subjects. 

This series is my humble attempt to communicate the beauty of mathematical 
statistics in comprehensible English to my fellow students (at Duke or at home). 
To facilitate this, we will take a "trust my word for it" approach, with proofs 
being in separate articles. However, I recommend at least reading through any 
proofs that I post. Struggling through those should prepare you for problems 
involving those same concepts. Even in the proofs articles, I'll go step-by-step 
(very granularly) for easy comprehension. That is not a luxury that professors 
get in a short lecture period, but I'll take my time to make sure every step is 
annotated, which I wish I had when I was in 432.

# Course Outline
This course is broadly broken into three sections. First, we will study point 
[estimators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimator). If you've never heard of 
estimators, don't worry. They're just educated guesses at unknown distribution 
parameters (like the mean of a normal distribution). We will calculate 
estimators, study them, and choose between them.

In the middle portion of the course, we will look at 
[confidence intervals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval). 
Again, no background knowledge is necessary here. In effect, confidence 
intervals tell us how confident we are that our chosen estimator falls into a 
particular range. Any statisticians reading just cringed at my description 
because it isn't technically accurate, but we will discuss why that's the case 
when we get to confidence intervals. Don't worry; it'll be pretty intuitive once 
we get there.

Last but certainly not least, we will conduct 
[hypothesis tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_hypothesis_test). 
There, we will choose two possible options for our estimator. For example, maybe 
we want to choose between X > 5 or X <= 5. We will use our data to decide which 
option is more likely to be correct. Of course, we will never be 100% of our 
guess, but we will get close.

And that's the course! It sounds nice and clean, and in many ways it is.
However, like with much of statistics, the findings are the easy part. Finding 
the findings is the challenge. But I'll try my best to get us through it so your 
GPA can be better than mine. 

# Course Materials

My course, which was run by Professor 
[Alexander Volfovsky](https://scholars.duke.edu/person/alexander.volfovsky), had 
very few requirements. There was a recommended textbook (found 
[here](https://www.amazon.com/Probability-Statistics-4th-Morris-DeGroot/dp/0321500466)), 
which I found helpful to get a second perspective on topics. But if the price is 
off-putting, don't worry. We only loosely followed it; apart from some homework 
questions, it was never explicitly required. So, for our purposes, I won't 
reference the book directly. If you want a second perspective and don't mind 
spending some coin, you have the Amazon link and can search the ISBN elsewhere.

Besides that, you'll only need a willingness to learn and a statistical 
curiosity!
