Americans in opposition to\nfederal gun ownership restrictions often cite mental health as the reason for \nAmerica's gun violence epidemic. In contrast, supporters of gun restrictions \nregularly blame America's comparatively loose regulatory environment and special \ninterest group involvement for the violence.\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), suicide by \nfirearm accounts for more than half of gun deaths in the United States. While \nschool shootings, mass shootings, and high-profile assassinations are regularly \nbrought into mainstream political discourse, suicide by gun is less frequently \ndiscussed. In this study, we investigate the potential relationships between \npro-gun special interest group activity, mental health, and suicide by firearm. \nWe aggregate over ten million responses to CDC health surveys, three million \nspecial interest group reports, and suicide by firearm rates for all 50 states. \nThese data are then used to build a multiple linear regression model to control \nfor the impact of lobbying efforts and mental health on rates of suicide by gun.\nTherefore, our research question is: *Does increased pro-gun special interest* \n*activity lead to additional suicide by gun, controlling for mental health?*\n\n## The Data\n\nWe have aggregated and cleaned data from three distinct sources. First, mental \nhealth data is pulled from the CDC \n[Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey](https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/annual_data/annual_data.htm)\n(BRFSS). The survey began including mental health questions in 1994. The \nquestion of interest for this study is:\n\n*\"Now thinking about your mental health, which includes stress, depression, and*\n*problems with emotions, for how many days during the past 30 days was your*\n*mental health not good?\"*\n\nResponses are given an integer value between 1 and 30. Respondents with zero \ndays of poor mental health are encoded with the value 88, which we have \nre-encoded as 0. Non-responses are not considered. Ultimately, 10,249,613 were \nconsidered, aggregated by state and year, and included in the model. We encode \nthese responses as binary: \"Poor\" or \"Good\" mental health. The CDC defines 15 or\nmore days of poor mental health in a 30-day period as concerning, so we encode \nresponses of 15 or greater as \"Poor\" and others as \"Good.\"\n\nThe CDC also provides absolute number and per-capita suicide data by state \nthrough their [CDC WONDER](https://wonder.cdc.gov/cmf-icd10.html) platform. \nPer-state proportions of suicides that were completed with firearms were \ncompiled by the [RAND Corporation](https://www.rand.org/pubs/tools/TL354.html), \na non-profit, non-partisan think tank that tracks and reports on several \nhigh-profile political issues in the United States. We calculate total firearm \nsuicide deaths by multiplying the total suicides of all types reported by the \nCDC and the proportion of those that were completed by firearm reported by RAND.\n\nSpecial interest group activity is provided by \n[Hall et al.](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/state-politics-and-policy-quarterly/article/chorus-a-new-dataset-of-state-interest-group-policy-positions-in-the-united-states/6827DC9EC72301016894F265777C0078) (2024). \nTheir special interest dataset reports 13,619,409 individual state-level special \ninterest group positions. We filter those positions using regular expression \nfilters built by hand from group names listed on\n[OpenSecrets](https://www.opensecrets.org/federal-lobbying/industries/lobbyists?cycle=2024&id=Q13), \nthe website of the eponymous non-profit organization that tracks lobbying groups \nand campaign finance in Washington, DC. We aggregate firearm-related special \ninterest group activity by year and state. Once gun-related groups were \ncompiled, we manually reviewed the 1,168 groups to remove any anti-firearm \nspecial interest groups from the data. Note that manual review is prone to human \nerror. Further details of these limitations are in the discussion section of \nthis article.\n\nMost year/state combinations have no special interest group representation \n(i.e., the number of reported special interest statements is 0). Initially, we \nattempted to include these zero values but ran into issues with \nheteroscedasticity. Ultimately, we maintained homoscedasticity by removing rows \nwith no special interest involvement. This reduction in data lessened the scope \nof our findings to states in which the pro-gun lobby has been active since 1997 \nbut allowed us to construct a more trustworthy model. The resulting dataset is \n186 observations in which a pro-gun group was active in a given state and year.\n\n# Methodology\n\nIn this study, we first construct an ordinary least squares (OLS) model using \nstate, the proportion of poor mental health, and the number of special interest \nstatements to predict the number of gun deaths from self-inflicted gunshot \nwounds per 100,000 citizens. However, Figure 1 shows that the number of special \ninterest statements in our dataset is power-law distributed. Thus, we perform a \nlog transformation to arrive at the predictor that we ultimately use in our \nmodel. Figure 2 shows the distribution of the log-transformed number of special \ninterest statements used in our model. In all cases, we will assume an \n$\\alpha=0.05$ level of significance.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmodel_data |>\n  ggplot(aes(x = lobbyist_positions)) +\n  geom_density(linewidth = 1.5, fill = \"darkcyan\", alpha = 0.5) +\n  theme_fivethirtyeight() +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Number of special interest statements\",\n    y = \"Density\",\n    title = \"Distribution of special interest statements\",\n    caption = \"Figure 1\"\n  ) +\n  theme(\n    plot.background = element_rect(fill = \"white\"),\n    panel.background = element_rect(fill = \"white\"),\n    axis.title = element_text()\n  )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](gun_violence_files/figure-pdf/lobbyist-dist-1.pdf){fig-pos='H'}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmodel_data |>\n  ggplot(aes(x = log_positions)) +\n  geom_density(linewidth = 1.5, fill = \"darkcyan\", alpha = 0.5) +\n  theme_fivethirtyeight() +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Number of special interest statements (log-transformed)\",\n    y = \"Density\",\n    title = \"Log-transformed special interest statements\",\n    caption = \"Figure 2\"\n  ) +\n  theme(\n    plot.background = element_rect(fill = \"white\"),\n    panel.background = element_rect(fill = \"white\"),\n    axis.title = element_text()\n  )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](gun_violence_files/figure-pdf/lobbyist-dist-log-1.pdf){fig-pos='H'}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nunweighted_model <- lm(\n  gun_suicides_per_100k ~ log_positions + p_poor_mental, \n  data = model_data\n)\n\nresid_data <- model_data |>\n  mutate(\n    preds = predict(unweighted_model, new_data = model_data),\n    resids = gun_suicides_per_100k - preds,\n    weights = 1 / abs(resids)^(1/2)\n  )\n\nupdated_model <- lm(\n  gun_suicides_per_100k ~ log_positions + p_poor_mental + state, \n  data = resid_data,\n  weights = weights\n)\n\nupdated_resid_data <- resid_data |>\n  mutate(\n    preds = predict(updated_model, new_data = model_data),\n    resids = gun_suicides_per_100k - preds\n  )\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nbp_unweighted <- round(lmtest::bptest(unweighted_model)$p.value, 3)\nbp_weighted <- round(lmtest::bptest(updated_model)$p.value, 3)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nWe evaluated the assumption of homoscedasticity (i.e., constant variance of \nresiduals) using a Breusch-Pagan (BP) test on our OLS model.

Also importantly, with a p-value of 0.89, mental health \ndoes not show a statistically significant impact on per-capita rate of suicide \nby firearm while holding state and special interest activity constant.\n\n# Discussion\n\nIn this study, we found statistically significant evidence that, holding state \nof residence and self-reported mental health constant, increasing pro-gun \nspecial interest group activity leads to additional suicide by gun. Perhaps \nequally importantly, we have shown that, while holding pro-gun special interest \nactivity constant, self-reported mental health rates do not show a statistically\nsignificant impact on the rate of suicide by gun.\n\nHowever, there are some crucial limitations and room for further research. \nFirst, only 17 states were ultimately included in the dataset used to train the \nmodel. Those 17 states were the ones in which pro-gun special interest activity \nwas tracked by Hall et al. It is possible that using a different metric for \npro-gun activism (pro-gun social media pages, pro-gun protests, etc.) would \nresult in more robust data across all states, leading to a much larger dataset \nand more room for additional predictors.\n\nSecond, pro- and anti-gun groups were tagged by hand. We developed custom \nregular expressions using manual research, but it is possible that some pro-gun \ngroups were removed and some anti-gun groups remained in the dataset. A dataset \ntagged with \"pro-gun\" and \"anti-gun\" when the dataset was created would help \nremove potential human error during filtering.\n\nFinally, although our results were statistically significant and passed model \nassumption checks, we did need to remove an outlier residual to pass our \nShapiro-Wilk test. There may be additional covariates for which a broader \ndataset may be able to correct to strengthen our confidence in our model \nfurther.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nThe American gun debate shows no signs of ceasing anytime soon. However, we have \nshown that there is reasonable doubt to the claim that America's gun violence \nproblems are caused by mental health alone. Although our result leaves room for \nfuture research, there is statistically significant evidence that, even when \nholding reported mental health status constant, pro-gun lobbying activity causes \ndeaths at an expected 3.38 deaths for each additional pro-gun special interest \neffort. While there are philosophical aspects to the gun debate that statistics \ncan never affirm or deny, we can be reasonably confident that the specific claim \nof mental health being the sole cause of American gun violence is not supported \nby evidence. Although the dispute continues, we hope our humble contribution to \nthe national discussion can help advance the cause of rational, evidence-based \ndebate.\n\nAs always, if you want to support my work, feel free to \n[buy me a coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/mitchellharrison) or stop by \n[Discord](https://discord.gg/vF6W2bdKFH) and say hello!\n\n___\n\n### Appendix\n\nBelow is the total result table, including all 17 states in the dataset.
