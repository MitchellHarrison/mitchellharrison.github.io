Riantsoa’s research is part of Project LIFEPLAN, which has the objective of inventorying biological species and developing statistical techniques for studying novel species. Riantsoa focused on four species of Madagascarian crickets: *Gryllus madagascariensis*, *Gryllodes sigillatus*, *Teleogryllus lemur*, and *Teleogryllus afer*, which have been determined to have the potential to be farmed as highly-nutritious protein sources.\n\nTo study the four species of crickets, 150 crickets of each species (600 crickets total) each were placed into their own box, which contained a 5 $\\times$ 5 $\\times$ 5 cm egg carton, 1 gram of feed, and 1 gram cotton ball. The boxes were placed into incubators with a constant temperature of 28 degrees C. Another objective was to keep humidity constant, but there were variations in humidity and thus those were recorded as well, since crickets are known to be sensitive to changes in humidity. The parameters that were measured for each cricket were growth (body weight and body weight), mortality, molting times, oviposition, and fecundity. These parameters were measured every 7 days, and it was also noted what stage in the life cycle the cricket was at (L1 through L5).\n\nThe data used for the case study were split into three different datasets. The `growth` dataset contained the data for the various aforementioned growth parameters. The `reproduction` dataset contained data on the reproductive activity of the randomly selected 20 mating pairs per species. The `temp_humid` dataset recorded information on the humidity of the incubators throughout the experiment.\n\n#### Observational Unit\n\nThe observational unit for this research was a randomly selected group of 150 crickets of each species from the total population of each cricket species being farmed. Also, to analyze reproductive activity for each species, 20 randomly selected breeding pairs of each species of crickets were chosen from the group of crickets initially chosen for this research.\n\n#### Relevant Variables\n\n-   `body_weight_g`: the weight of a cricket (in grams)\n-   `growth_time`: the number of days hatched passed between a given day a cricket was measured and when the cricket hatched\n-   `growth_rate`: daily body mass growth rate (grams/day for a particular cricket, calculated as `body_weight_g` / `growth_time`)\n-   `species`: the species of the particular cricket (*Gryllus madagascariensis*, *Gryllodes sigillatus*, *Teleogryllus lemur*, or *Teleogryllus afer*)\n-   `hatched_eggs`: number of eggs hatched by a given breeding pair\n\n#### Research Question\n\nThe overall objective of the research project is to determine which species of crickets is best suited for cultivation. Compared to traditional protein sources, cultivating crickets is much more cost effective in terms of land and feed needed. Therefore, crickets can be farmed as a food source in regions where the environment is otherwise unfriendly to livestock cultivation. Cricket meat has already been successfully made into cricket flour, which can be used to make nutritious snacks such as cricket crackers. \n\nBased on the data, we determined that it would be best to look at which species of crickets has the highest average of meat produced per day. Meat produced per day is the change in body mass per cricket per day (grams/day for a particular cricket) multiplied by the total number of crickets in a population; in order to determine the total number of crickets in a population, we will model the number of eggs hatched by a given cricket species breeding pair. Thus, the main research question that this case study aims to address is what species of crickets, on average, have the largest amount of meat produced per day.\n\n\\newpage\n\n#### EDA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](crickets_files/figure-pdf/eggs-success-1.pdf)\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on this plot, it can be observed that the distributions of the proportion of successful eggs hatched for each of the breeding pairs grouped by species appear to be unimodal and right skewed. The medians of the distributions for *Gryllus madagascariensis* + *Teleogryllus afer* and *Gryllodes sigillatus* + *Teleogryllus lemur* respectively are very similar, with the second pair having slightly higher medians. In addition, the difference between the medians appears to be less than 0.01.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](crickets_files/figure-pdf/growth-rate-life-stage-1.pdf)\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe growth rates for all four species appear to be very similar between the L1 and L4 life stages, but Gryllus madagascariensis appears to have a significantly larger increase in growth rate compared to the other species. Additionally, *Gryllus madagascariensis* and *Teleogryllus afer* matured to the L5 stages about a week before the other two species. In the L5 life stage, *Gryllus madagascariensis* grew as large as 5 times the size of the largest individuals of the other species.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\n|Species                  | Not Dead| Dead|\n|:------------------------|--------:|----:|\n|Gryllodes sigillatus     |      127|   23|\n|Gryllus madagascariensis |      140|   10|\n|Teleogryllus afer        |      117|   33|\n|Teleogryllus lemur       |      134|   16|\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis table summarizes the proportion of crickets that were dead and alive by species at the end of the research experiment. The table shows that *Gryllus madagascariensis* had the lowest proportion of dead crickets and the highest proportion of crickets that were alive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](crickets_files/figure-pdf/hatch-times-1.pdf)\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis plot visualizes the distribution of the time each egg cluster took to hatch after laying by species. It appears that the majority of *Gryllus madagascariensis* eggs took 15 days or more to hatch. On the other hand, for the other three species, all eggs hatched within 12 days. In addition, all of *Teleogryllus afer* eggs hatched in 10 days or less.\n\nBased on the EDA, it appears that the average proportion of eggs hatched in relation to the total number of eggs laid is very similar regardless of species or genus. In addition, it is significant to note that in comparison to the other three species of crickets, *Gryllus madagascariensis* crickets were measured to have a significantly higher growth rate between the L4 and L5 stages, longer hatch times, and both the highest proportion of living crickets and lowest proportion of dead crickets at the end of the experiment.\n\nThere were also some additional factors of consideration that were noted during the EDA. For example, there could be a possibility of crickets eating their own molts, which could have affected the researchers' counts. In addition, crickets could have also eaten unhatched eggs, thus potentially affecting the counts of hatched eggs per breeding pair.\n\n## Methodology\n\n#### Data Cleaning\n\nIn order to ensure a data set that satisfies the assumptions of independence, we decided to only include the observations in which the individual cricket had reached the 42nd day to be measured for our model which left us with the 600 individual crickets (150 per species) which is the exact number of crickets per sepcies used in the experiment.\n\nWe also added a new variable for measuring growth (`growth_time`), which we defined as the number of days hatched passed between a given day a cricket was measured and when the cricket hatched.\n\nFor the `reproduction` dataset, in order to satisfy the assumptions of independence, we took the mean number of eggs hatched by a breeding pair and rounded down so that the data could be used for our Poisson model that requires an integer response variable.\n\n#### Model Overview and Justification\n\nWe initially implemented two Bayesian generalized linear models using `stan_glm()` from the `rstanarm` package.\n\nThe first model is a model from the Gaussian family that had the daily growth rate as the response variable with species as the predictor. This model used a normal prior using the sample mean regardless of species and sample standard deviation regardless of species. The second model is a model from the Poisson family with log-link that had the number of eggs hatched for a given breeding pair as the response variable with species as the predictor. This model also used a normal prior with sample mean and sample standard deviation of the number of eggs hatched per breeding pair regardless of species. \n\nBoth models contain a single intercept (for *Grillodes sigillatus*), and posterior samples reported for the other three species are deviations from that intercept. As such, posterior samples for non-intercept species are added to the intercept samples and are shown in the following histograms. For example, a posterior sample of 50 eggs for *Grillodes sigillatus* and a coefficient estimate of -10 for *Teleogryllus afer* would result in a reported sample of 40 eggs for *Teleogryllus afer*.\n\nWe decided to use a Gaussian family model for predicting daily growth rate because it is a continuous variable, which matches the support of the Gaussian distribution. Similarly, we decided to use a Poisson family model for predicting the number of eggs hatched because the support is the same as that of the Poisson distribution, which is only natural numbers starting from 0.\n\nWe use the sample mean and sample standard without regard for species to avoid skewing our results too heavily based off of information from our observational data because of the comparatively small number of cricket breeding pairs compared to the number of breeding pairs one would be cultivating in the real world.\n\nAfter running sampling from these two models, two separate posterior distributions were generated. The values from these posterior distributions were then multiplied together to get a final distribution of meat produced per breeding pair per species per day.\n\n#### Model Assumptions\n\nFor this model, two assumptions were made. Because dead crickets were not measured for their body mass, we dropped these dead crickets from our dataset under the assumption that they would not contribute to our final meat production. Based on the EDA, it was observed that the four species of crickets, especially *Gryllus madagascariensis*, experienced significant growth in body weight between the L4 and L5. For the model used in this case study, the growth rate between L4 and L5 has been collapsed such that the growth rate from day 1 to day 42 is assumed to be linear.\n\n## Results\n\n#### Bayesian Daily Growth Rate Model\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](crickets_files/figure-pdf/viz-growth-rate-1.pdf)\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#### Bayesian Hatched Eggs Model\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](crickets_files/figure-pdf/viz-eggs-1.pdf)\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#### Final Meat-per-day Distribution\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](crickets_files/figure-pdf/posterior-meat-per-day-1.pdf)\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\\begin{table}\n\\caption*{\n{\\large \\textbf{Posterior 95\\% confidence intervals}}\n} \n\\fontsize{12.0pt}{14.4pt}\\selectfont\n\\begin{tabular*}{\\linewidth}{@{\\extracolsep{\\fill}}l|rrrrrr}\n\\toprule\n & \\multicolumn{2}{c}{Growth rate\n(per-cricket)} & \\multicolumn{2}{c}{Eggs hatched} & \\multicolumn{2}{c}{Meat per day*} \\\\ \n\\cmidrule(lr){2-3} \\cmidrule(lr){4-5} \\cmidrule(lr){6-7}\n & 5\\% & 95\\% & 5\\% & 95\\% & 5\\% & 95\\% \\\\ \n\\midrule\\addlinespace[2.5pt]\nGryllodes sigillatus & {\\cellcolor[HTML]{EDEDED}{\\textcolor[HTML]{000000}{0.0008}}} & {\\cellcolor[HTML]{EDEDED}{\\textcolor[HTML]{000000}{0.0016}}} & 67.79 & 73.84 & {\\bfseries \\cellcolor[HTML]{EDEDED}{\\textcolor[HTML]{000000}{0.05}}} & {\\bfseries \\cellcolor[HTML]{EDEDED}{\\textcolor[HTML]{000000}{0.12}}} \\\\ \nGryllus madagascariensis & {\\cellcolor[HTML]{EDEDED}{\\textcolor[HTML]{000000}{0.0126}}} & {\\cellcolor[HTML]{EDEDED}{\\textcolor[HTML]{000000}{0.0144}}} & 68.82 & 75.01 & {\\bfseries \\cellcolor[HTML]{EDEDED}{\\textcolor[HTML]{000000}{0.91}}} & {\\bfseries \\cellcolor[HTML]{EDEDED}{\\textcolor[HTML]{000000}{1.03}}} \\\\ \nTeleogryllus afer & {\\cellcolor[HTML]{EDEDED}{\\textcolor[HTML]{000000}{0.0007}}} & {\\cellcolor[HTML]{EDEDED}{\\textcolor[HTML]{000000}{0.0024}}} & 68.79 & 74.97 & {\\bfseries \\cellcolor[HTML]{EDEDED}{\\textcolor[HTML]{000000}{0.08}}} & {\\bfseries \\cellcolor[HTML]{EDEDED}{\\textcolor[HTML]{000000}{0.14}}} \\\\ \nTeleogryllus lemur & {\\cellcolor[HTML]{EDEDED}{\\textcolor[HTML]{000000}{0.0012}}} & {\\cellcolor[HTML]{EDEDED}{\\textcolor[HTML]{000000}{0.0029}}} & 68.79 & 74.97 & {\\bfseries \\cellcolor[HTML]{EDEDED}{\\textcolor[HTML]{000000}{0.12}}} & {\\bfseries \\cellcolor[HTML]{EDEDED}{\\textcolor[HTML]{000000}{0.18}}} \\\\ \n\\bottomrule\n\\end{tabular*}\n\\end{table}\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe are 95% confident that for a given breeding pair of *Gryllodes sigillatus* crickets, we expect that the average meat per day outputted would be between 0.06 g and 0.12 g. We are 95% confident that for a given breeding pair of *Gryllus madagascariensis* crickets, we expect that the average meat per day outputted would be between 0.92 g and 1.03 g. We are 95% confident that for a given breeding pair of *Teleogryllus afer* crickets, we expect that the average meat per day outputted would be between 0.08 g and 0.14 g. We are 95% confident that for a given breeding pair of *Teleogryllus lemur* crickets, we expect that the average meat per day outputted would be between 0.12 g and 0.18 g.\n\n## Discussion\n\nBased on our combined model output, the *Gryllus madagascariensis* species is best fit for cultivation based on the average meat outputted per breeding pair for a given species with the caveat that the *Gryllus madagascariensis* species has a longer mean incubation time in days (Appendix fig. 1) and negligibly lower lifetime hatch rate (Appendix fig. 2) when compared to its counterpart species which might make lengthen the time it takes to start up cricket meat production.\n\nWe do feel that the model development process using the data for this case study was limited in terms of finding variables in the dataset to use as predictors. The limitations can be attributed to how the only main independent variable we found was the species of crickets, since this was experimental data collected, it is reasonable that there was only one independent variable. One of the few metrics in which *Gryllus madagascariensis* underperformed relative to the other species was time to hatch after the eggs had been laid. However, this issue only affects the initial startup time and increases the need for egg storage.\n\nBecause the datasets had limited number of parameters that we could use as predictors, we would recommend in the future that Riantsoa and the researchers run a different experiment with just the *Gryllus madagascariensis* and adjust for other factors that were controlled in this experiment, such as humidity and temperature. We also recommend using more breeding pairs in future experiments, as there were only 20 breeding pairs per species of cricket. With further experimentation on the optimal conditions for *Gryllus madagascariensis* cultivation, access to better alternative protein sources in areas that lack the necessary infrastructure and environment for traditional livestock cultivation can continue to improve. Success in this area of research could lead to more efficient and equitable access to protein sources.\n\n\\newpage\n\n## Appendix\n\n#### fig. 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](crickets_files/figure-pdf/viz-incubation-time-1.pdf)\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#### fig. 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](crickets_files/figure-pdf/viz-egg-success-rate-1.pdf)\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Changes From Original Submission\n\nThe feedback provided had a suggestion for improvement regarding the \nintroduction, specifically adding in more context about the research study and\nwhy studying the cultivation of crickets is significant. We added the following\nto our discussion of the research question in the introduction:\n\n  > Compared to traditional protein sources, cultivating crickets is much more cost effective in terms of land and feed needed. Therefore, crickets can be farmed as a food source in regions where the environment is otherwise unfriendly to livestock cultivation. Cricket meat has already been successfully made into cricket flour, which can be used to make nutritious snacks such as cricket crackers. \n\nOn our initial submission feedback, a concern was noted that we did not\nsufficiently explain that there were not per-species intercepts in either of the\nmodels. We added the following text to note the single intercept and explain\nthe displayed results:\n\n  > Both models contain a single intercept (for *Grillodes sigillatus*), and posterior samples reported for the other three species are deviations from that intercept. As such, posterior samples for non-intercept species are added to the intercept samples and are shown in the following histograms. For example, a posterior sample of 50 eggs for *Grillodes sigillatus* and a coefficient estimate of -10 for *Teleogryllus afer* would result in a reported sample of 40 eggs for *Teleogryllus afer*.\n \nWe also had too much of a negative tone to our conclusion, so we changed some of\nthe language to end on a \"high note.\" That language is here:\n\n  > With further experimentation on the optimal conditions for *Gryllus madagascariensis* cultivation, access to better alternative protein sources in areas that lack the necessary infrastructure and environment for traditional livestock cultivation can continue to improve. Success in this area of research could lead to more efficient and equitable access to protein sources.",
