# Introduction

In 1887, steamship captain 
[William "Billy" Moore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Moore_(steamship_captain))
and First Nation explorer 
["Skookum Jim" Mason](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keish) hiked the White Pass 
route through what would become the Alaska-Canada border. Billy Moore liked what
he saw and purchased the coastal land now home to the gold rush town of Skagway,
Alaska. With its modest present-day population of around 1,200 permanent 
residents, modern Skagway hosts over one million annual tourists. 

Although Billy Moore and Skookum Jim had to conquer forests, mountains, and 
wildlife to arrive at the remote land where Skagway now lies, modern tourists 
have much simpler transit options. American citizens can drive a few miles north
of [Juneau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juneau,_Alaska) (Alaska's capital) to 
arrive via the Klondike Highway. Canadian tourists have two additional options:
take the bus or the train south, across the Canadian border, and directly into 
downtown Skagway.

Of the Canadian tourists visiting Skagway, the majority come via the bus route 
south from the Yukon Territory. Because of the massive flood of tourists 
visiting by bus, the Skagway port of entry into the US boasts a unique feature:
it is the only land port of entry through which more people enter the US by bus
than any other method.

Every American port of entry has a story. For Skagway, it's explorers taming the
wilderness to make room for a future bus route. Vanceboro, Maine, is one of only
two majority-rail entrances. Only two ports (both along the southern border) are
majority pedestrian. The rest, in true North American fashion, are dominated by
privately-owned cars.

But more than tourists come through our borders. Illicit drugs, trafficked 
persons, and other illegal imports make it into the US through land ports of
entry every day. In this report, we will investigate land traffic trends going
back over  two decades to see if we can uncover clues to what may be
responsible for the increase in opioid deaths (specifically fentanyl) that
America is currently combating.

# The Data

The US Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) is a statistical agency under 
the US Department of Transportation (DoT). The BTS publishes 
[border crossing data](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/border-crossing-entry-data-683ae)
through land ports of entry. Maritime and aircraft crossings are handled by 
other agencies and thus aren't included in the data. The data includes the 
geographic position of the ports, the number of crossings in those ports, and 
the method of each crossing.

Before we look at the data, we need to define a crossing. The BTS defines a 
crossing as a single vehicle (or pedestrian) crossing into the US a single time.
If, for example, a single truck goes between the US and Mexico multiple times to
pick up and deliver goods, each entry into the US is a separate crossing. These
crossings could be foreign tourists, immigrants, or American citizens returning 
home.

Additionally, we will bring in overdose data from the NIH. 
[That data](https://nida.nih.gov/research-topics/trends-statistics/overdose-death-rates#Download),
published from 1999 to 2022 (so far), will help us build a more comprehensive
picture of the modern opioid epidemic.

Now that we have our background and definitions, let's get to know our borders.

# Data Analysis

## Today's crossings

Before we explore our past, let's get to know our present. In 2024, there were 
`r scales::comma(sum(border24$value))` border crossings across every American 
land port. Over `r round(p_pov*100, 0)`% of the vehicles that crossed were 
personal vehicles, like your car or mine. Although there are
`r length(unique(border$port_code))` unique ports, not all entrances are created
equal. Let's look at a map to see where most of our inbound traffic comes from,
and which types of traffic are most common there. @fig-leaflet-map is an
interactive map showing the traffic coming through our land ports in 2024.

  ) |>
  # add custom title box to the map
  addControl(map_title, position = "topright")
```

That sea of red you're seeing shows how dominant personally owned vehicles are 
at nearly every land port. Of our two borders, there was significantly more 
traffic from the south; the only high-traffic entrances from the north are
Buffalo, Detroit, and Blaine (outside of Vancouver). However, the San Ysidro
port of entry in southern California outnumbered all crossings from those three
ports combined. The majority of our land traffic very clearly comes from Mexico
and from privately owned vehicles.

## Total crossings

Traffic across our land borders has become a hot topic in our politics. 
President Trump has 
[imposed tariffs](https://apnews.com/article/trump-tariffs-mexico-canada-b19e004dddb579c373b247037e04424b?taid=67c60d3c0119c30001f7fd9b) 
on both Mexico and Canada in an attempt to reduce the flow of illicit drugs 
(specifically fentanyl) and trafficked people into the US. Because most fentanyl
is smuggled into the US 
[by American citizens](https://www.cato.org/blog/fentanyl-smuggled-us-citizens-us-citizens-not-asylum-seekers), 
it is worth investigating total crossings instead of crossings made by 
immigrants. @fig-crossings-over-time explores our total inbound crossings
per year in all land ports in the US.

    marker = list(size = 11, color = RED),
    hovertemplate = "<b>Crossings</b>: %{y:,.0f}",
    name = ""
  ) |>

    title = "Border crossings into the US through land ports (1996-2024)",

    hovermode = "x unified"
  ) |>
  config(displayModeBar = FALSE)
```

There are a few interesting notes from our border crossing history. First, we 
saw a rapid and steady decrease in border crossings after 2000. That could be 
related to decreased international travel by American citizens following the 
9/11 attacks and 
[increased security](https://www.cfr.org/timeline/us-postwar-immigration-policy),
but without data to back that hypothesis, we can only speculate. 

After 2011, we see a slow increase in crossings until the pronounced drop during
the COVID-19 pandemic. It's more difficult to point to direct policy changes 
that explain that increase during both the Obama and Trump administrations, so 
I will reserve my speculation. Interestingly, we have effectively returned to 
pre-COVID levels.

::: {.callout-note}
Observe the y-axis scale in @fig-crossings-over-time. Even during the drop in
crossings during the pandemic, we saw over 200 million unique crossings.
Although that's much lower than is typical, it is still significant in absolute
number.

## Crossing distribution

Since effectively all fentanyl imports 
[come through the southern border](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg93nn1e6go) 
and via US citizens, it is worth exploring the distribution of crossings between
Canada and Mexico. @fig-country-distribution examines the evolution of that
distribution since 1996.

      opacity = 0.2,
      y0 = 0.05,
      y1 = 0.95,
      x0 = 2020,
      x1 = 2022,
      layer = "below"
    )),
    annotations = canada_note
  ) |>
  config(displayModeBar = FALSE)
```

Even as @fig-crossings-over-time shows us total crossings have fluctuated by the
hundreds of millions since 1997, the proportion of those crossings coming from
Canada and Mexico have been remarkably consistent. Besides the
[Canadian travel](https://travel.gc.ca/travel-covid) measures causing dwindling
crossings during the pandemic, about three of every four crossings have come
from Mexico every year since 1997.

While 
[opioid deaths](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db522.htm#:~:text=After%20the%20age-adjusted%20rate,5.7%25%20from%2019.4%20to%2018.3.)
have been growing as a proportion of all overdose deaths since 1999, the
proportion of crossings from each border remains consistent, and total land
crossings have stagnated (save COVID-era declines). With total traffic not
growing and the proportion of crossings coming from the south constant, factors
outside of these datasets are likely responsible for the increase in opioid
deaths. The 
[per-dose lethality of fentanyl](https://www.dea.gov/resources/facts-about-fentanyl),
[industry-manufactured opioid addictions](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7479783/),
and other socioeconomic issues are more likely culprits.

# Conclusion

We have shown that, since at least 1995, southern border crossings have 
surpassed northern ones by approximately three-to-one. However, total traffic 
over land has dwindled or held constant in the same period, while the proportion
of overdose deaths caused by opioids has increased.

Since almost all 
([89%](https://usafacts.org/answers/how-much-fentanyl-is-seized-at-us-borders/country/united-states/))
of illicit fentanyl comes from legal land ports of entry and 
([90%](https://www.cbp.gov/border-security/frontline-against-fentanyl)) from US
citizens, analyzing otherwise legal border crossings is a worthwhile endeavor.
This analysis shows that while opioid deaths spike, land traffic of the type 
that typically imports fentanyl (US citizens crossing through legal ports of
entry to the south) has not. Non-border issues are likely to blame for the
current crisis.

Combating the fentanyl crisis will require an ongoing, multi-faceted approach. 
While border security is essential, mainly due to the 
[comparatively small amount](https://www.yalemedicine.org/news/fentanyl-driving-overdoses#:~:text=One%20reason%20is%20that%20because,the%20symptoms%20of%20opioid%20withdrawal.)
of fentanyl that can kill large numbers of civilians, decreasing border traffic
is unlikely to make a significant positive impact. The Centers for Disease 
Control (CDC)
[recommends](https://www.cdc.gov/overdose-prevention/about/fentanyl.html)
using fentanyl test strips to prevent taking drugs laced with
fentanyl and using naloxone (Narcan) to stop overdoses after they begin. Federal
funds could easily subsidize free community access to these resources while
increasing education on effectively using them.

and visualization or the fentanyl crisis and border traffic. If you have any
