# Introduction

Hello all! Welcome to TidyTuesday! This week, journalist Elizabeth Hawley
provides us with data that documents mountaineering expeditions in the Nepal
Himalaya, the mountain range that includes Mount Everest. There were a few
variables that piqued my interest, so I thought we could build a model to see
if any of my those variables are related to fatalities during expeditions. Let's
read and clean the data!

```{r}
#| label: read-libs-and-data

library(ggthemes)
library(gt)
library(tidyverse)

exped <- read_csv(
  paste0(
    "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/",
    "main/data/2025/2025-01-21/exped_tidy.csv"
  )
) |>
  janitor::clean_names()

peaks <- read_csv(
  paste0(
    "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/",
    "main/data/2025/2025-01-21/peaks_tidy.csv"
  )
) |>
  janitor::clean_names()

climbs <- exped |>
  left_join(peaks) |>
  mutate(
    deaths = mdeaths + hdeaths,
    is_fatal = if_else(deaths > 0, T, F),
    season_factor = factor(
      season_factor,
      levels = c("Winter", "Spring", "Summer", "Autumn")
    ),
    agency = factor(agency)
  ) |>
  drop_na(is_fatal)
```

# Exploratory Analysis

Of course, it wouldn't be TidyTuesday without a little bit of data viz. I'm
thinking that oxygen use might predict deaths, although I have absolutely no
domain knowledge in the field of mountaineering. My concern is that oxygen is
only used after a certain altitude, so oxygen use and mountain height may be
highly correlated. Let's see if that's the case, adding in the number of days
that an expedition takes as a second axis.

```{r}
#| label: vizualize-oxygen-use

climbs |>
  mutate(o2used = if_else(o2used, "O2 used", "No O2 used")) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = highpoint, y = totdays, color = o2used, shape = o2used)) +
  geom_jitter(size = 2.5) +
  theme_fivethirtyeight() +
  scale_color_fivethirtyeight() +
  labs(
    title = "Higher altitude means oxygen use",
    subtitle = "Summit height, length of journey, and oxygen",
    x = "High point (m)",
    y = "Total days"
  ) +
  theme(
    axis.title = element_text(),
    legend.title = element_blank()
  )
```

So my assumption was correct: oxygen is mostly used at altitudes over 7,500
meters. I'll add both to the model to see if one is more significant than the
other. I'm also curious to see if winter expeditions are more lethal, so we'll
use winter as the baseline season against which we will compare all other
seasons. I'll also add the high point of the expedition, since we want to hold
it constant when analyzing the effect of oxygen use.

Before we build our model, let's see how many of our expeditions proved fatal.

# The Model

```{r}
#| label: visualize-fatalities

climbs |>
  mutate(is_fatal = if_else(is_fatal, "Fatal", "Non-Fatal")) |>
  group_by(is_fatal) |>
  summarise(prop = n() / nrow(climbs)) |>
  rename(Fatality = "is_fatal", Proportion = "prop") |>
  gt() |>
  fmt_number(columns = Proportion, decimals = 3) |>
  tab_header(md("**Expedition Fatalities**"))
```

Uh-oh, only 4% of the expeditions were fatal. With such an imbalance between
the binary outcomes, ordinary logistic regression may struggle with class
imbalance. Instead, we will use Firth's logistic regression, which is designed
to combat this exact problem. It will penalize the likelihood function using
a penalty term related to the
(Jefferys Prior)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffreys_prior]. Long story
short, it will help correct for the class imbalance issue. Let's build the model
and see what we get!

*Note: For ease of interpretation, I have exponentiated the coefficients.*

```{r}
#| label: build-model
#| results: hide

# using Firth's logistic regression to account for few TRUE response values
model <- logistf::logistf(
  is_fatal ~ highpoint + season_factor + o2used + totdays, 
  data = climbs
)

model_summary <- summary(model)
results <- tibble(
  term = names(model_summary$coefficients),
  coef = exp(model_summary$coefficients),
  p_value = model_summary$prob
)

results$term <- c("Intercept", "High Point", "Season | Spring",
                  "Season | Summer", "Season | Fall", "O2 Used",
                  "Total Days")
colnames(results) <- c("Variable", "Coefficients", "P-value")
```

```{r}
#| label: display-model

results |>
  filter(Variable != "Intercept") |>
  gt() |>
  fmt_number(columns = c("Coefficients", "P-value"), decimals = 3) |>
  tab_header(md("**Model Results**"))
```

# Results

Interpreting logistic regression can be awkward, so let's start with the 
p-values. At the $\alpha = 0.05$ level, only the use of oxygen shows a
significant association with the fatality of an expedition. Holding season,
high point, and total days constant, the use of oxygen increases the probability
of a fatality by 4.78-fold. Interestingly, season has no statistically
significant association with fatality when holding other variables constant.
I assumed that the baseline season (winter) would be significantly more fatal,
but that's not the case.

However, it's important to recognize the limitations of our model. Oxygen use
can be caused by many factors. We have already shown that height predicts 
oxygen use, but so can medical emergencies or other variables that can appear
during an expedition. It would be worth doing more analysis on oxygen use
specifically to look for a causal relationship, rather than simple association.

# Conclusion

Thanks for your attention! Firth's logistic regression was new to me, so I got
to learn from the modeling process *and* from the model itself. Lucky me! I hope
you got something out of this little analysis project, and if you'd like to ask
me any questions, feel free to send me a connect request on

Thanks for your attention, and I'll see you next time!
